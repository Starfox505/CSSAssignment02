        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="centered-image" src="../images/Family.jpg" alt="A picture of a man and woman holding and kissing a dog together, while the dog is looking into the camera.">
        <p>My name is Brendan Drewry, and I am 23 years old! I recently got married to my amazing wife Jessica, and we both share a dog, whom is featured above in the picture, and her name is June.</p>
        <p>I graduated High School in 2016 in Lemoore at KCS, and I have been going to College for around four to five years now at West Hills College Lemoore. I am currently studying Computer Programming at West Hills, as this has been a massive interest of mine for a long time. I also have my Associates Degree in Psychology, and am close on getting my Associates in Administration of Justice and Health and Science.</p>
        <p>My biggest interests are movies, television, books, and music! I am a massive fan of interesting storytelling in any manner of speaking! While I have seen thousands of films and many Television shows, I also collect films and TV shows and have close to 1,000 in my collection. Filmmaking has always been a massive passion of mine, and while Programming is a very interesting and engaging thing to me, Filmmaking is what I ultimately would love to do and hope to down the road.</p>
