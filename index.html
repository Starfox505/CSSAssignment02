    <p class="bold">What do you hope to learn from this CSS course?</p>
    <p>Firstly, I hope to be able to style my pages in an extremely professional manner. This will help employers see my range in CSS and web design in general.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I hope to be able to make my fonts extremely pretty, engaging, and nice to look at, as I feel this is extremely important in web design!</p>
    <p>Lastly, I hope that this class is able to help grasp color scheming and color coordination, as I do have colored blindness and can't quite grasp this idea yet.</p>
