    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p class="bold">What do you hope to learn from this CSS course?</p>
    <p>Firstly, I hope to be able to style my pages in an extremely professional manner. This would include: nice structure for a webpage, beautiful eye catching design, and correct scaling. This will help employers see my range in CSS and web design in general.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I hope to be able to make my fonts extremely pretty, engaging, and nice to look at, as I feel this is extremely important in web design! While it may not seem very important, I feel it is one of the first things clients look at when they first open your webpage.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I hope that this class is able to help grasp color scheming and color coordination, as I do have colored blindness and can't quite grasp this idea yet. This has been a massive struggle for me for many years, and I hope I am able to overcome this in this class, as it can become a big problem in this profession.</p>
